Inspirations 
============

I would have loved to have said that I created everything my self, however, below are some of the sites from which I took inspiration from and also, looked for code snippets.

Programming WT588D Sound Board 
------------------------------

In learning how to program the sound board (WT588D-U-32m) I used the following sites:

* Initial understanding of the software and how to programme a simple button playback (i.e. standalone) [Standalone WT588d](http://www.instructables.com/id/WT588D-Standalone-Arduino-sound-player/)
* Programming the WT588D in single line serial mode including sample code to drive the chip from arduino [Single Line Serial Mode](http://www.ars-informatica.ca/eclectic/programming-the-wt588d-sound-module-part-4-one-line-serial-mode/)
* The WT588D [Instruction Manual](https://www.elechouse.com/elechouse/images/product/MP3%20WT588D%20USB%20module/WT588D-U%20Voice%20Module.pdf)
